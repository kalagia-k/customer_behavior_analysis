# Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, from raw data ingestion to insights delivery.  
It covers data loading and analysis in Python, SQL querying on a SQL Server database, interactive visualization in Power BI, and communication of results through a written report and presentation.

The goal is to showcase practical skills across the full analytics stack, with a strong focus on clarity, structure, and business-oriented insights.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Provided dataset (CSV / database table)
- **Content:** Customer and transactional data used to analyze patterns, trends, and key performance indicators
- **Scale:** Medium-sized dataset suitable for exploratory and SQL-based analysis

> The dataset is first explored and cleaned in Python, then stored and queried using SQL Server for structured analysis.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** – Data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **SQL Server** – Data storage and analytical SQL queries
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard and visual analytics
- **Gamma** – Presentation (PPT) creation
- **Markdown / Word** – Final written report and documentation

---

## Project Steps
1. **Data Loading**
   - Imported raw data into Python for initial inspection

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics
   - Distribution analysis
   - Trend and pattern identification

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values
   - Data type corrections
   - Removing duplicates and inconsistencies

4. **SQL Analysis**
   - Loaded cleaned data into SQL Server
   - Wrote SQL queries to answer key business questions
   - Aggregations, joins, and filtering for insights

5. **Dashboard Development**
   - Built an interactive Power BI dashboard
   - Visualized KPIs, trends, and customer behavior

6. **Reporting & Presentation**
   - Created a structured analytical report
   - Designed a professional presentation using Gamma

---

## Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard provides:
- High-level KPIs for quick insights
- Interactive filters for deeper exploration
- Clear visualizations designed for business users

It enables stakeholders to explore trends without requiring technical knowledge.

---

## Results & Insights
- Identified key customer behavior patterns
- Highlighted trends and performance drivers
- Delivered insights in both visual and written formats for different audiences

This project emphasizes **communicating insights clearly**, not just performing analysis.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Python Analysis**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook
   - Run all cells to reproduce EDA and data cleaning

2. **SQL Queries**
   - Load the cleaned dataset into SQL Server
   - Execute the provided `.sql` file to reproduce queries

3. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop
   - Refresh the data connection if needed

4. **Report & Presentation**
   - Review the written report for detailed findings
   - Open the Gamma presentation for a high-level summary

## Notes
- This project reflects a real-world data analytics workflow
- Focus is placed on **reproducibility, clarity, and business relevance**
- Suitable as a portfolio project for data analyst and BI roles
